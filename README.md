Legal Contracts on Web3

Gree is a groundbreaking project designed to revolutionize the way legal contracts are managed on the web. Leveraging the Solana blockchain's low-cost NFT minting capabilities, Gree offers an efficient, secure platform for electronically signing and organizing legal documents. Utilizing Metaplex for NFT minting and IPFS for document storage, it ensures that contracts are accessible and immutable. Gree aims to widen the adoption of electronic signatures beyond its current limited use, facilitating a seamless transition from traditional web platforms to the decentralized web (Web3). By employing account abstraction, Gree simplifies the user experience, making it as intuitive as conventional methods while offering the benefits of blockchain technology. This innovative approach not only makes legal document management more accessible globally but also provides a scalable solution for large organizations to manage their legal contracts efficiently.


# Road to Future of Legal Contracts
Gree envisions transforming the global legal landscape by democratizing access to secure, efficient, and transparent contract management through blockchain technology. By harnessing the power of the Solana network, Gree aims to drastically reduce costs and barriers associated with legal processes, making it accessible to individuals and businesses worldwide. Our vision extends beyond simplifying transactions; we aspire to foster trust, facilitate seamless international agreements, and promote a universally accessible legal framework. Gree's innovative approach to utilizing NFTs for contract management represents a significant leap towards a future where legal processes are not only digitized but also decentralized, paving the way for a more equitable and interconnected global community.

# Development Plan

## 1. Smart Contract Development on Solana:

- Variables and Storage:
    - Implement smart contracts on the Solana blockchain, using Rust for high performance and security. Define variables for contract parties, document hashes, and signature verification statuses. Utilize Solana's account model for efficient storage and access control.
- NFT Minting with Metaplex:
    - Integrate with Metaplex protocol for NFT minting, representing each legal contract as a unique NFT. This includes creating metadata standards for contract details (e.g., parties involved, contract date, expiration) and storing actual contract documents on IPFS for immutability.
- Contract Signing and Verification:
    - Develop functions for digital signing of contracts, where each party can sign the contract NFT using their blockchain wallet. Implement verification processes to ensure all required signatures are collected and valid before marking a contract as fully executed.
- Access Control and Permissions:
    - Design access control mechanisms to ensure that contract documents and their signatures can only be accessed by the parties involved or authorized entities, enhancing privacy and security.

## 2. Front-End Development:
  - User Interface:
  Design a user-friendly web interface that facilitates the easy creation, signing, and management of legal contracts. This includes forms for contract creation, a dashboard for managing existing contracts, and views for contract details and signing status.
  - Web3 Integration:
Integrate Web3 functionalities to connect users' blockchain wallets (e.g., Phantom, Solflare) for signing transactions and interacting with the smart contracts. Ensure smooth account abstraction for a seamless transition from traditional web to Web3.
  - Notifications and Updates:
Implement a notification system to alert users about contract updates, such as new signatures required or contract completions, enhancing the user experience and engagement.

## 3. Testing and Quality Assurance:
  - Conduct thorough testing of both smart contracts and the front-end application, including unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing (UAT) to ensure reliability, security, and usability.

## 4. Security Audits and Optimization:
  - Perform security audits on the smart contracts to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities. Optimize contract code for efficiency and cost-effectiveness, considering the unique aspects of the Solana blockchain.

## 5. Beta Release and Community Feedback:
  - Launch a beta version of the platform to a limited user base to gather feedback on usability, features, and potential issues. Use this feedback to refine and improve the platform before the final release.

## 6. Deployment and Launch:
  - Deploy the fully tested and audited smart contracts to the Solana mainnet. Launch the front-end application on a scalable cloud hosting platform. Initiate marketing campaigns to promote the platform and attract users from around the globe, marking the official launch of the project.


# Story Time: Why am I creating this?

  As a dedicated attorney working with a diverse range of clients, from individuals to corporations and public authorities, I've encountered firsthand the challenges of the global legal landscape, particularly the absence of a universal method for signing and managing legal contracts and conducting due diligence. Driven by a desire to address this pressing issue and streamline legal processes, I turned to the Solana blockchain. Its power and efficiency inspired me to develop a solution that could not only revolutionize contract management but also make it accessible and reliable worldwide, bridging the gap in the current legal framework.



# Getting Started
This guide will walk you through the steps to install and set up Gree on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have installed all programs and packages on following notion page:

https://steel-station-46c.notion.site/gree-prerequisites-linux-1b67ad003f6c478d9dc0ffb1be1bdf5d?pvs=4


## Installation

### Clone the Repo
`git@github.com:asimnecip/gree.git
cd gree`

### Install node modules
`npm i`

### Build and Deploy Rust Backend
Ensure your Solana wallet is set up and funded. You'll need this to deploy contracts and interact with the Solana blockchain.

- `anchor build`
- `anchor deploy`

## Run the Development Server

Launch the development server with:

sh
Copy code
yarn start
This command runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

Deploy Smart Contracts
Before using Gree, you'll need to deploy the smart contracts to the Solana blockchain:

Build the Smart Contract

sh
Copy code
cd smart-contract
cargo build-bpf
Deploy to Solana

Make sure your Solana CLI is configured to the correct network (devnet, testnet, mainnet-beta).

sh
Copy code
solana deploy /path/to/your/contract.so
Note the program ID output by the command. You'll need to update your application's configuration to include this program ID.

Usage
With Gree installed and running, you're ready to explore its features:

Create Legal Contracts: Use the UI to create new legal contracts.
Sign Contracts: Parties can sign contracts using their Solana wallets.
Manage Contracts: View and manage your existing contracts through the dashboard.
